A Number Guessing Android Game with libgdx

A simple number guessing game made with libgdx framework.

Just import the project to Android Studio to run. 

Some notes:
- Zoom buttons are added to test zooming functionality.

TODO List:


- Numbers should go to their original place if touched again. ( This is important )
- Destroyed ships should always be seen in screen. If a ship is destroyed while it wasn't on the screen,
  explosion image is drawed in its last position, thus it isn't visible.
- Add AI.
